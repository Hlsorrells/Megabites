# Megabites Recipe App

## Description
Megabites provides users with a place to find, create and share recipes. Users are free to create recipes, browse recipes posted by others, create reviews on recipes, and save recipes to their profiles. Recipes are easy to find and use and are not buried beneath 1500 lines of the creatorâ€™s story about how they found this recipe in the first place.

## Usage

To begin using Megabites, any user may browse the homepage which provides a brief description of the recipe, its categories, and the creator's username. The homepage recipes are an assortment of recipes from the community that can be filtered by selecting a category from the drop-down menu. Any user can click on the recipe to be taken to a recipe page that displays the full details of the recipe including cooking instructions and ingredients.

By completing the signup, users become members with the priviledges to create recipes and save recipes from the community. To create a login, click on the signup button to be taken to the signup form. The only information that will be made public is the username of the member. This lets other users know who posted the recipe for the community to enjoy. Once the signup form has been submitted, users are free to login and begin building their personalized list of recipes.

Member users can create a recipe by clicking on the down arrow next to their member name and selecting "Add a recipe" from the dropdown menu. This will take the member to the form to complete to submit a recipe to the community. Recipes will be saved to both the community home page and the member's page.

Members also have the added feature of saving a community recipe to their page. Once a user is logged in, a save button appears at the bottom of each recipe card. Users can click on this button while browsing to add recipes to their personal page. The save button will not redirect the user to their homepage, but remain on the community page to allow the user to continue browsing without losing their place. Users will also find this save button located on the full recipe page to make saving new and interesting recipes very easy.

An additional feature for members is the delete button on their personal page. When users save a recipe to their personal page, they have the ability to delete the recipes they are no longer interested in keeping. While the recipe is removed from the member's personal page, it remains available to other users through the community home page.

Members can now submit reviews on recipes including a star rating to promote favorites to the community. Reviews will only show the member's username so privacy is maintained. The recipe does not have to be saved to the member's page in order to be reviewed which allows members to comment on recipes that they may not have enjoyed. The homepage reflects the average star rating for each recipe. All of the reviews can be read inside the full recipe page.
